# Git Full Setup and Connect to Github Account : 
**Here I provide the full instruction to install Git on linux and set it up with your github repo.**

1) First to install all about git in linux :

	`$ sudo apt-get install git`

Now git is installed and no need to build it from Source !

2) Then to connect git to your github account, 
you need a SSH key to introduce your device to your account : 

	To generate SSH key on your linux device : 

	Use this command : 

	`$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "alijafari13791397@gmail.com"`

3) After running the above command press **Enter** to save the SSH key in its default path !

- Otherwise can set your own password to generate files there (just has 2 files)

Now asks for password : Enter your password
If no need for password ---> again press **Enter**
